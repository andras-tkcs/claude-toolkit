# Stewarding a pull request

This is the generic policy. It sits alongside the project's own docs (branch hygiene, release
mechanics, code and test conventions) and the profile's `project_steward` file, if there is one;
where the project's file is more specific, it wins. Load the `project-profile` skill first.

## Work that has to leave this machine

A Claude Code on the web container is Linux, has no code-signing identity, no other operating
system, and no live credentials for external services. A project may also have deliberate policy
that real credentials never reach a pull-request-triggered workflow. None of that is a reason to
skip a checklist row. If a CI workflow for the job exists, a session can dispatch it **against its
own branch** and read the result back.

The project's table is `ci.dispatchable` in the profile: for each entry, `workflow` is the file to
dispatch, `use_when` says when, and `notes` carries inputs and cautions. Read it, show the relevant
rows when you decide, and dispatch with the GitHub MCP `actions_run_trigger` (read the run with
`actions_get` and `get_job_logs`). If the profile has no `ci.dispatchable`, nothing can be
dispatched: say so, and name the row you could not verify.

Things about dispatching that are true everywhere:

- **The workflow must already be on the default branch.** GitHub only offers `workflow_dispatch`
  for workflows present on the default branch; the `ref` you pass selects which checkout runs. A
  workflow added on a feature branch is not dispatchable until that branch merges.
- **A queued run is correct behaviour, not a hang**, when the workflow declares a concurrency group.
  Wait; do not re-dispatch.
- **A workflow that commits back to your branch** means you pull before you continue working.
- **A recorded file is still a diff to read.** Output that arrived by dispatch (fixtures, snapshots,
  generated files) gets the same review as anything else: no account identifier, tenant URL, token
  or private content may enter the repository.
- **Never push a release tag from a session.** The container can push branches but not
  `refs/tags/*`, and cutting a release is the maintainer's decision. If a release workflow is
  listed, dispatch its dry run if it has one, report it, and wait to be told.
- **A missing credential or capability is not a test failure.** It is a dispatch.

## Which pull requests to follow

- **A PR this session opened is this session's to drive to green.** Subscribe to it
  (`subscribe_pr_activity`), and keep working it until CI passes and it is mergeable. That is the
  default and this file does not soften it.
- **Do not follow dependency-bot PRs** unless the maintainer asks: a version bump is a supply-chain
  decision for a person. The project's steward file may name other PRs to leave alone.
- **Stop at merge or close.** Nothing further is owed.

## A red check is real until proven otherwise

*A second red run on the same commit is real and must not be re-run away.* Apply it to every check.

- Never skip, disable, mark expected-failure or quarantine a test to get to green.
- Never push an empty commit, or close and reopen a PR, to kick CI.
- A coverage or quality threshold failure means the new code needs tests or fixes, not that the
  threshold needs lowering.
- A static-analysis finding that is genuinely a false positive is suppressed at the call site with a
  reason, never by loosening the project's configuration.
- Read the failing job's log (`get_job_logs`) before acting; do not guess from the check name.

## Conventions worth restating because they are easy to get wrong

- **Branch names.** Follow `git.branch_pattern`. A Claude Code on the web session is assigned a
  `claude/<generated-name>` branch it cannot rename or push around: if the pattern cannot be met
  from there, use the assigned branch and put the type in the PR title instead. Apply the pattern
  normally anywhere it can be followed.
- **Merge style.** If the profile sets `git.merge_style`, PRs merge that way (`merge-commit` means
  every commit message on the branch survives into the main branch's history individually, so write
  each one for that audience).
- **Never open a version heading in the changelog on a feature branch** (when `docs.changelog` is
  set): entries go under `docs.changelog.section`.
- **A protected branch is protected like the main branch.** If work targets a long-lived integration
  branch the project documents, branch from it and PR back into it.
